Hi! Welcome to my profile on Github.

## Who am I?

1. Go to [estrogen.zone](https://estrogen.zone)
2. Once the CSS animation hell (i spent way too long abusing css) is done, navigate towards whatever, at the time of you browsing, indicates it's an "About Me" styled page
3. If it dies, ensure JS is enabled (im trying hard to make it look good with nonjs support, without duplicating all the content - dw, im working on tooling for this to not be a long-term problem)
4. Enjoy reading!

## Contributions

Please do not use this for contributing to my software! Treat this as a read-only mirror for archival purposes. It may be out of date or otherwise incorrect.

If you do decide to submit a PR here, accompany it with a patch sent to the project's mailing list on wherever the project's upstream is - ~~usually that's [estrogen.zone's sourcehut instance](https://git.sh.estrogen.zone)~~ nvm sourcehut self-hosting sucks, am  working on some new shit (for projects too small for mailing lists, [send me a patchfile directly](mailto:memdmp@estrogen.zone) ([how to make a patchfile](https://git-send-email.io/))) and make sure the commit messages are properly formatted. See [torvalds/linux#17](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5654674) for further information on github overall, and [torvalds/linux#17 (issuecomment-5660417)](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5660417) about commit messages.
